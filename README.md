# Portfolio2
View the project here: https://jordangregson.github.io/Soft-Colors-Responsive-Portfolio-Design-Portfolio2-/
My second attempt at making a portfolio. My goal was to take what I started in my first version, but improve it. I also attempted to make this one responsive. This website is initially designed for my girlfriend, but I removed her name.
